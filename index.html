                    <p>Now this is the story all about how
                        My life got flipped, turned upside down
                        And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
                        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air
                    </p>

                    <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
                        On the playground where I spent most of my days
                        Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
                        And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
                        When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
                        Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
                        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                        And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air"
                    </p>

                    <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
                        License plate said "fresh" and had a dice in the mirror
                        If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                        But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!
                    </p>

                    <p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
                        And I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!"
                        Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
                        To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air
                    </p>
